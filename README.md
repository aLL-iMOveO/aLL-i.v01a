# Algorithm to Achieve Conceptual Product Design on Digital Twin Built on CNN Model 

The algorithm presented here details the steps needed to achieve conceptual product design on a Digital Twin built on a CNN model. The algorithm starts with designing and developing a digital concept model to accurately conceptualize the desired product design. Scripting or sketching the design on GitHub repositories, enabling APIs, leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms on the All-i framework, plugging the transformed models into chatbot frameworks, interfacing the All-i master API on the transformer model to create the digital twin, enabling the digital twin on the master CNN model, leveraging automation platforms to connect to other related products and services for fast and reliable development of products, validating and approving the product design, and monitoring the product performance post-deployment are some of the key steps in this algorithm. The algorithms also describe how to use Google Kubernetes engine and compute engine for scalability and stronger support, streamline the design process and make the product available to the consumer faster, and access and collaborate with all stakeholders for efficient and secure communication. By following the mentioned steps, an AI-powered system can be created for product design with automated, accurate, and efficient processes. All of this can be automated with the help of Autopilot for pre-processing, normalizing, batching, training, and optimizing the model. The AI-powered system ensures accuracy and efficiency in the product design process, allowing for faster implementation in the market and better decision making.
